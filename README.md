# Rubik-s-Cube-Simulator-and-Solver
My own, from-scratch implementation of the Rubik's cube simulation model and most importantly, my own, new algorithm for solving the cube (in progress)

## Documentation

### Overview
The Rubik-s-Cube-Simulator-and-Solver project showcases a custom Rubik's cube simulation and a novel algorithm for solving the puzzle, developed entirely from scratch.

### Features
- Rubik's cube simulation model
- Custom solving algorithm (currently in progress)

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ngrjchk/Rubik-s-Cube-Simulator-and-Solver.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Ensure Python is installed.
4. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Open the provided notebooks to explore simulation and solving techniques.

### Usage
- Use `my_cube_solver.ipynb` to test the simulator and solver (currently in progress)
- Use `table_generators.ipynb` for generating and exploring useful computation tables.
